**Step 4.** By pressing the buttons on both sides of the plastic attachment you can remove your OnlyKey from your keyring to insert it into USB.

**Step 5.** (Optional) Insert OnlyKey into silicone case as shown [here.](#onlykey-case)

***PRO TIP - (Optional) Check out OnlyKey accessories - [color cases]({#onlykey-case}), [keychain options]({#keychain-options}), [mobile adapter]({#android-support}).***

**Step 6.** Insert the OnlyKey into USB port.

**Step 7.** Once the OnlyKey has been successfully attached to the computer the Initial Setup Wizard screen will appear. Select "Next" to continue.

***LINUX USERS NOTE: If you are using Linux your system may by default only allow read access to USB devices including the OnlyKey. In order to allow read/write access follow the instructions[ here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Go_Rs218fKUx-j_JKhddbSVTqY6P0vQO831t2MKCJC8/edit?usp=sharing) to create a udev rule. Also see the following forum topic [here.](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/onlykey/MnD03gQzczg)***

**Step 8. Select OnlyKey Edition** - This is where you select the edition of OnlyKey that you have. If you are a US customer select Standard Edition. For international customers (outside of US) the OnlyKey comes pre-loaded with the International Travel Edition as shipping devices with military grade encryption is problematic in some countries. If strong encryption is permitted in your country ([check here](http://www.cryptolaw.org/)) then you may load the standard OnlyKey firmware by following the instructions in the [Firmware Loading](#loading-onlykey-firmware) section and then return to initial setup.
