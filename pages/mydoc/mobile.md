### About Mobile Support

Using a security key with a mobile device is possible, however most mobile devices already have a built-in security key. Before using OnlyKey with a mobile device here are some considerations.

|  | Built-in Security Key | USB Security Key | NFC Security Key |
|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| Physical Security* | Medium | High | Low |
| Convenience | High | Low | Medium |

*NFC devices are vulnerable to attacks from a close proximity (someone bumps into you) while USB and built-in security keys are vulnerable with authenticated access to the device (someone steals your phone/key and your fingerprint/pin). Mobile device built-in secure element is generally higher security and more convenient than an NFC device.

Recently, [Android](https://fidoalliance.org/news-your-google-android-7-phone-is-now-a-fido2-security-key/) and [iOS](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301509/apple-safari-14-browser-face-touch-id-logins-webauthn-fido2) have added support for using the built-in secure element as a FIDO2 security key. We recommend this for most user's that require two-factor authentication on a mobile device as most apps support the built-in mobile security.

#### How to Use Built-in Security Key on Android

Android Example:
- Open the Chrome browser and browse to https://www.passwordless.dev/mfa#heroFoot.
- Create a test account, and when prompted select "Use this device with Fingerprint or PIN" to register, do the same to sign in.

#### How to Use Built-in Security Key on iOS

iOS Example:
- Open the Safari (14 or later) browser and browse to https://www.passwordless.dev/mfa#heroFoot.
- Create a test account, and when prompted select the built-in security key to register, do the same to sign in.

#### How Built-in Mobile Biometric 2FA Works Together with OnlyKey

OnlyKey can be used together with mobile apps that permit login via fingerprint (Touch ID / Face ID). Just use OnlyKey to enter password and/or 2FA for the mobile app first time login, then once logged in enable the built-in mobile biometric 2FA for future logins.

### OnlyKey Mobile Prerequisites

- Ensure the latest firmware is loaded on OnlyKey. Instructions are available [here](https://docs.crp.to/usersguide.html#loading-onlykey-firmware) for loading firmware.
- Connect to mobile device using adapter. On-the-go USB-C, Lightning and multi adapters may also be purchased [here](https://onlykey.io/collections/accessories-1).
- To encrypt/decrypt a key must be loaded on OnlyKey. Instructions are available [here](https://docs.crp.to/usersguide.html#generating-keys).

### Android/iOS Static Password, TOTP, and Yubikey OTP Support

Since the OnlyKey is essentially detected by mobile device as a keyboard, the username / password / YubikeyÂ® OTP login features will work.

The TOTP feature requires the correct time in order to generate correct codes. In order to set the time on OnlyKey browse to https://apps.crp.to from Chrome or Firefox in Android (Safari in iOS) before trying to login.

### Using OnlyKey as a Security Key on Android

- Browse to the site you wish to use OnlyKey with
- Register OnlyKey as a security key (Android has several pop up messages that you must accept to proceed)
