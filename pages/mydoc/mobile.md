### OnlyKey For iPhone and Android

Modern mobile devices like [iPhone](https://webkit.org/blog/11312/meet-face-id-and-touch-id-for-the-web/) and [Android](https://fidoalliance.org/news-your-google-android-7-phone-is-now-a-fido2-security-key/) already contain a security key (FIDO2 authenticator) and support strong authentication features like TouchID and FaceID.

What works well for most mobile users is to use OnlyKey for the first login to a new app. After the first login the app has the option to enable Touch/FaceID to log in from then on. This allows enforcing strong passwords (typed by OnlyKey) and two-factor authentication while also not requiring to plug OnlyKey in each time.

Using OnlyKey for the first login to a new app is easy and no adapter is required for [OnlyKey DUO](https://onlykey.io/duo) (USB-C) devices. For OnlyKey (USB-A) and iPhone a USB adapter is available [here](https://onlykey.io/collections/accessories-1).

### Mobile Security Considerations

Before using a security key with a mobile device here are some considerations.

|  | Built-in Security Key | USB Security Key | NFC Security Key |
|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| Physical Security* | Medium | High | Low |
| Convenience | High | Low | Medium |

*NFC devices are vulnerable to attacks from a close proximity (someone bumps into you) while USB and built-in security keys require physical access (someone steals your phone/key and your fingerprint/pin). A mobile device's built-in security key is generally both higher security and more convenient than an NFC device.

#### How to Use Built-in Security Key on Android

Android Example:
- Open the Chrome browser and browse to [https://www.passwordless.dev/mfa#heroFoot](https://www.passwordless.dev/mfa#heroFoot).
- Create a test account, and when prompted select "Use this device with Fingerprint or PIN" to register, do the same to sign in.

#### How to Use Built-in Security Key on iOS

iOS Example:
- Open the Safari (14 or later) browser and browse to [https://www.passwordless.dev/mfa#heroFoot](https://www.passwordless.dev/mfa#heroFoot).
- Create a test account, and when prompted select the built-in security key to register, do the same to sign in.

{% include tip.html content="Built-in Mobile Biometric 2FA Works Together with OnlyKey <br>OnlyKey can be used together with mobile apps that permit login via fingerprint (Touch ID / Face ID). Just use OnlyKey to enter password and/or 2FA for the mobile app first time login, then once logged in enable the built-in mobile biometric 2FA for future logins." %}

### OnlyKey Mobile Prerequisites

- Ensure the latest firmware is loaded on OnlyKey. Instructions are available [here](https://docs.crp.to/usersguide.html#loading-onlykey-firmware) for loading firmware.
- Connect to mobile device using adapter. On-the-go USB-C, Lightning and multi adapters may also be purchased [here](https://onlykey.io/collections/accessories-1).
- To encrypt/decrypt a key must be loaded on OnlyKey. Instructions are available [here](https://docs.crp.to/importpgp.html#generating-keys).

### Android/iOS Static Password, TOTP, and Yubikey OTP Support

Since the OnlyKey is essentially detected by mobile device as a keyboard, the username / password / YubikeyÂ® OTP login features will work.

The TOTP feature requires the correct time in order to generate correct codes. In order to set the time on OnlyKey browse to https://apps.crp.to from Chrome or Firefox in Android (Safari in iOS) before trying to login.

### Using OnlyKey as a Security Key on Android

Registering and logging in with OnlyKey as a security key on Android is almost the same as using on a desktop computer. This is currently supported using Firefox and Chrome browsers for Android. To use OnlyKey as a security key:

- Enter PIN to unlock OnlyKey
- Browse to the site you wish to use OnlyKey with
- Register OnlyKey as a security key (Android has several pop up messages that you must accept to proceed)

This is currently supported using Firefox and Chrome browsers for Android. To use OnlyKey to encrypt/decrypt files:

- Plug OnlyKey into mobile device using adapter
- Enter PIN to unlock OnlyKey

- Enter your Keybase username and the recipient's username (if you are encrypting files for yourself this is your username)
- Select files to encrypt and click encrypt and sign
- Accept the pop-up messages that appear so that the device may communicate with OnlyKey
- Enter the challenge code on OnlyKey

{% include tip.html content="The challenge code is an added security feature, if ease of use is the priority this can be turned off so that pressing any button will confirm. To do this set 'Disable Challenge Code for PGP' in the OnlyKey app preferences." %}
