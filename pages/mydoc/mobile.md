### Prerequisites

- Ensure the latest firmware is loaded on OnlyKey. Instructions are available [here](https://docs.crp.to/usersguide.html#loading-onlykey-firmware) for loading firmware.
- Mobile device using adapter, these may also be purchased [here](https://onlykey.io/collections/accessories-1).
- To encrypt/decrypt a key must be loaded on OnlyKey. Instructions are available [here](https://docs.crp.to/usersguide.html#generating-keys).

### Android/iOS Static Password, TOTP, and Yubikey OTP Support

Since the OnlyKey is essentially detected by mobile device as a keyboard, the username / password / YubikeyÂ® OTP login features will work.

The TOTP feature requires the correct time in order to generate correct codes. In order to set the time on OnlyKey browse to https://apps.crp.to from Chrome or Firefox in Android (Safari in iOS) before trying to login.

- Enter PIN to unlock OnlyKey
- Browse to the site you wish to use OnlyKey with
- Register OnlyKey as a security key (Android has several pop up messages that you must accept to proceed)
