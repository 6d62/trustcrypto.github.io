### OnlyKey Apps and Software {#apps}

[OnlyKey Desktop App](https://docs.crp.to/app.html) is used for setup and configuration of OnlyKey. Supported on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Chrome OS (with Chrome App).

[OnlyKey WebCrypt](https://docs.crp.to/webcrypt.html) provides a way to securely use OnlyKey in the browser. The Webcrypt app loads everything necessary to encrypt messages and files directly in the local browser without the need to send messages or files over the Internet. Data between [OnlyKey](https://onlykey.io) and the local browser is end-to-end encrypted. WebCrypt integrates with services like [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) and [Protonmail](https://protonmail.com) to provide OpenPGP encryption and key management everywhere on-the-go. Supports browsers Chrome, Chromium/Brave, and Firefox. Supports Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS.

[OnlyKey Agent](https://docs.crp.to/onlykey-agent.html) is a hardware-based SSH and GPG agent that allows offline cold storage of your SSH and OpenPGP keys. SSH is a popular remote access tool that is often used by administrators and with OnlyKey remote access can be passwordless by physically pressing OnlyKey button to log in. GPG (or GnuPG) is a versatile OpenPGP tool that provides encryption and signing. Instead of keeping keys on a computer, OnlyKey generates and securely stores your keys off of the computer and you can still easily use SSH and GPG.

[Firmware](https://docs.crp.to/firmware.html) - This is the software that runs on the OnlyKey itself. The OnlyKey firmware is open source and can be loaded onto the OnlyKey by following the instructions in the User's Guide.

The firmware releases can be found [here.](https://github.com/trustcrypto/OnlyKey-Firmware/releases)

[Command-line Utility](https://docs.crp.to/command-line.html) - The OnlyKey Command-Line Utility is a command line tool targeted towards more advanced users. This can be used for configuration, scripting, and testing.
